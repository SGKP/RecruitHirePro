## üêõ BUGS FIXED

### ‚úÖ Bug #1: Analytics Showing "React: 0 Students"
**FIXED:** Changed analytics API to show ALL skills, not just those with positive gaps.

**Before:**
```javascript
if (gap > 0) skillGaps.push(...); // Only showed React if no students had it
```

**After:**
```javascript
const allSkills = new Set([...skillDemand, ...skillSupply]);
allSkills.forEach(skill => {
  // Shows React even when supply > 0
});
```

### ‚úÖ Bug #2: Buttons Not Working
**FIXED:** Added proper onClick handlers and href attributes

- **Shortlist:** `onClick={() => alert('Shortlisted!')}`
- **View Resume:** `<a href={candidate.resume_url} target="_blank">`
- **Contact:** `<a href={mailto:${candidate.email}...}>`  
- **GitHub:** `<a href={https://github.com/${candidate.github_username}}>`

### ‚úÖ Bug #3: Showing Candidate ID Instead of Name
**FIXED:** Changed display from `candidate.student_id.slice(-6)` to `candidate.name`

Enhanced search-candidates API to return full candidate data:
```javascript
return {
  name: student.user_id?.name || 'N/A',
  email: student.user_id?.email || 'N/A',
  gpa: education.gpa || 'N/A',
  graduation_year: education.graduation_year || 'N/A',
  // ... etc
}
```

### ‚úÖ Bug #4: Plain Grey Backgrounds
**FIXED:** Applied gradient backgrounds to ALL 9 pages

**Before:** `bg-gray-50`
**After:** `bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50 to-indigo-50`

### ‚úÖ Bug #5: Missing GPA/Year Display
**FIXED:** Added to search-candidates API response and candidates page display

Now shows:
- üéì GPA: 3.8
- üìÖ Year: 2025
- üè´ University Name
