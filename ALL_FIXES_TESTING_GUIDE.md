# 🔧 ALL ISSUES FIXED - TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED:**

### 1. **Resume Upload Now Fills ALL Fields** ✅
**Problem:** Only skills were being added, GPA/University/Degree empty  
**Root Cause:** Data saved to `resume_parsed_data` but forms didn't read from there properly  
**Fix:**
- ✅ Profile fetch now reads from BOTH `student.gpa` AND `resume_parsed_data.education.gpa`
- ✅ Resume upload saves to `resume_parsed_data` (for storage)
- ✅ Forms display correctly from nested data structure

### 2. **Achievements Extraction Added** ✅
**Problem:** No achievements extracted from resume  
**Fix:**
- ✅ Added regex to extract experience/internships from resume
- ✅ Parses job titles and bullet points
- ✅ Saves up to 3 achievements automatically
- ✅ Shows achievement count in success alert

### 3. **Cultural Test Form Jumping Fixed** ✅
**Problem:** Form slides/jumps up when clicking radio buttons  
**Root Cause:** Radio button change event triggered form validation/scroll  
**Fix:**
- ✅ Changed to `onClick` handler on label instead of `onChange` on input
- ✅ Added `e.preventDefault()` to stop default behavior
- ✅ Made radio input `pointer-events-none` (label handles clicks)
- ✅ Form now stays stable when answering

## ⚠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Still only skills showing"**
**Check:**
1. Look at browser console (F12) - any errors?
2. Terminal logs - does it show "GPA found: 3.8"?
3. If GPA shows in terminal but not in form, the issue is frontend
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

**Fix:**
- Restart server
- Clear browser cache
- Check fetchProfile function runs after upload

### **"Achievements empty"**
**Reason:** Resume doesn't have EXPERIENCE section with bullet points

**Format needed:**
```
Job Title
Company Name
• Bullet point 1
• Bullet point 2
```

**Use:** `•`, `-`, or `*` for bullet points

### **"Cultural test still jumps"**
**Check:**
1. Are you on the latest version of the file?
2. Did server reload after fix?

**Test:**
- Click on the label text (not the radio button itself)
- Should work smoothly now

---

## 🚀 **READY TO TEST!**

**All 3 major issues fixed:**
1. ✅ Resume fills ALL fields (not just skills)
2. ✅ Achievements extracted from resume
3. ✅ Cultural test form stable (no jumping)

**Next Steps:**

2. Watch ALL fields auto-fill
