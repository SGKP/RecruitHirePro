DIALOGFLOW_CREDENTIALS=./dialogflow-key.json
```

### Step 3: Train XGBoost Model
```python
# Python script to train model
import xgboost as xgb
import pandas as pd

# Load historical data
data = pd.read_csv('hiring_history.csv')
X = data[feature_columns]
y = data['retention_outcome']

# Train model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    n_estimators=100
)
model.fit(X, y)
model.save_model('retention_model.json')
```

### Step 4: Deploy Model API
```javascript
// api/ai-copilot/predict.js
import xgboost from 'xgboost-node';

const model = xgboost.loadModel('retention_model.json');

export async function POST(req) {
  const { features } = await req.json();
  const prediction = model.predict([Object.values(features)]);
  return Response.json({ 
    success_probability: prediction[0],
    confidence: prediction[1]
  });
}
```
