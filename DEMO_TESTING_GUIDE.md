## 📊 DATABASE QUICK CHECK

### Check Student Data
```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or Mongo shell:
db.students.findOne({}, {
  name: 1,
  linkedin_url: 1,
  current_year: 1,
  achievements: 1,
  "resume_parsed_data.skills": 1,
  "resume_parsed_data.education": 1
})
```

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  linkedin_url: "https://linkedin.com/in/...",
  current_year: "3rd Year",
  achievements: [
    { title: "Won Hackathon", description: "...", date: "2024-09-15" }
  ],
  resume_parsed_data: {
    skills: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
    education: {
      gpa: "3.8",
      degree: "Bachelor of Science",
      university: "Stanford University"
    }
  }
}
```

### Check Jobs Data
```javascript
db.jobs.find({}, { title: 1, required_skills: 1, applications_count: 1 })
```

### Check Applications
```javascript
db.applications.find({}).populate('student_id').populate('job_id')
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "React shows 0 students" in Analytics
**Solution:** Already fixed! Analytics API now uses:
```javascript
const allSkills = new Set([
  ...Object.keys(skillDemand),
  ...Object.keys(skillSupply)
]);
```

### Issue: Candidate shows ID instead of name
**Solution:** Already fixed! search-candidates API now returns:
```javascript
name: student.user_id?.name || 'N/A'
```

### Issue: Buttons don't work
**Solution:** Already fixed! All buttons have proper handlers:
- Shortlist: `onClick={() => handleShortlist(candidate.name)}`
- View Resume: `href={candidate.resume_url}`
- Contact: `href={mailto:${candidate.email}...}`
- GitHub: `href={https://github.com/${candidate.github_username}}`

### Issue: Apply Now doesn't work
**Solution:** Already fixed! API endpoint created at `/api/student/apply`

### Issue: Can't edit profile
**Solution:** Already fixed! `/api/student/profile` supports PUT method with new fields
