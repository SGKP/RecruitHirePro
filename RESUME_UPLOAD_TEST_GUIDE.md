## ⚠️ IF NOTHING HAPPENS

### Check 1: Browser Console (F12)
Look for red error messages. Common issues:
- Network error → Check server is running
- 401 Unauthorized → Login again
- 500 Server error → Check terminal logs

### Check 2: Terminal Output
Look for these errors:
- ❌ `Module not found` → Server needs restart
- ❌ `MissingSchemaError` → **FIXED!** (User model now imported)
- ❌ `Cannot resolve pdf-parse` → **FIXED!** (Import path corrected)

### Check 3: File Format
- Must be .PDF file
- Not .DOC, .DOCX, .TXT
- Browser will show "No file uploaded" if wrong format

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Resume uploaded but fields empty"
**Cause:** Resume format doesn't match patterns

**Fix:**
- Use exact keywords: "University of", "GPA:", "Bachelor"
- Check terminal for "Not found" messages
- Manually fill missing fields

### "Upload button does nothing"
**Cause:** No file selected or wrong format

**Fix:**
- Make sure file ends with `.pdf`
- Check file is selected (not just clicked)
- Look for error in browser console

### "500 Internal Server Error"
**Cause:** Server-side issue

**Fix:**
- Check terminal for red errors
- Restart server if needed
- Check MongoDB is running

### "Skills not detected"
**Cause:** Skills not in keyword list or spelled differently

**Fix:**
- Use exact names: "JavaScript" not "JS"
- Add skills manually after upload
- Skills are case-insensitive
