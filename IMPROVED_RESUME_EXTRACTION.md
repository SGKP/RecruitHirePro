## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST:**

1. **Upload your resume**
2. **Check terminal** - you'll see ALL extracted fields
3. **Check browser alert** - shows what was extracted
4. **Go to profile page** - ALL fields auto-filled!

### **If Some Field Not Extracted:**

**Terminal will show:**
```

```

**Solutions:**
1. Check if your resume has "University" or "College" keyword
2. Make sure university name is near "EDUCATION" section
3. Copy the PDF text from terminal (first 500 chars)
4. Send me the text so I can improve the pattern

## 📝 **BEST PRACTICES FOR RESUME:**

### ✅ **DO:**
