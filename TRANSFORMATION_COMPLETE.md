## 🔢 UPDATED RETENTION ALGORITHM (TODO)

**Current Implementation:** Still uses 6-question logic
**File to Update:** `app/api/recruiter/search-candidates/route.js`

**New Algorithm (Design):**
```javascript
function calculateRetentionScore(culturalFitness) {
  let score = 50; // Base score
  
  // Team Dynamics (up to 15 points)
  if (cf.team_preference === 'In collaborative teams') score += 5;
  if (cf.conflict_handling === 'Address directly and immediately') score += 3;
  if (cf.collaboration_style === 'Contribute equally') score += 4;
  if (cf.team_contribution === 'Facilitate communication') score += 2;
  if (cf.group_role === 'Supporter/helper') score += 1;
  
  // Work Style (up to 10 points)
  if (cf.work_life_balance === 'Very important - strict boundaries') score += 3;
  if (cf.work_environment === 'Structured and stable') score += 2;
  if (cf.deadline_management === 'Plan ahead to avoid rush') score += 2;
  if (cf.remote_preference === 'Hybrid (2-3 days office)') score += 2;
  if (cf.schedule_flexibility === 'Flexible hours (choose start/end)') score += 1;
  
  // Learning & Growth (up to 10 points)
  if (cf.learning_preference === 'Mentorship and guidance') score += 3;
  if (cf.upskill_method === 'Side projects and experiments') score += 2;
  if (cf.feedback_preference === 'Regular structured reviews') score += 3;
  if (cf.challenge_approach === 'Collaborate with team') score += 1;
  if (cf.mentorship_preference === 'Like to mentor others too') score += 1;
  
  // Career Goals (up to 10 points)
  if (cf.career_focus === 'Making impact') score += 2;
  if (cf.five_year_vision === 'Leadership/management role') score += 3;
  if (cf.leadership_interest === 'Very interested - want to lead teams') score += 3;
  if (cf.specialist_generalist === 'T-shaped (deep + broad)') score += 1;
  if (cf.company_size_preference === 'Large corporation (500+)') score += 1;
  
  // Communication (up to 5 points)
  if (cf.communication_style === 'Collaborative and inclusive') score += 2;
  if (cf.meeting_preference === 'Regular team syncs') score += 1;
  if (cf.written_verbal === 'Mix of all') score += 1;
  if (cf.presentation_comfort === 'Love presenting to large groups') score += 1;
  if (cf.update_frequency === 'Weekly updates') score += 0; // No bonus
  
  return Math.min(score, 100); // Cap at 100%
}
```

**This gives:**
- Base: 50%
- Perfect team player: 50% + 15 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 100%
- Poor fit: 50% (base only)
